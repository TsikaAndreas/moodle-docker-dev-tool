# üõ†Ô∏è Moodle Docker Development Tool

This repository contains a bash script designed to simplify the setup and management of a Moodle development environment using Docker. The script automates the installation, configuration, and permissions setup required for running Moodle within a Dockerized environment.

Key features include:

- **Full Development Setup:** Automates the creation of project directories, cloning of the Moodle Docker repository, copying necessary configuration files, and setting up environment variables using `direnv`.

- **Permission Management:** Ensures proper file and directory permissions for the Moodle project, setting defaults that work seamlessly with the `www-data` group used by web servers.

- **Moodle Codebase Management:** Automatically clones a specific version or branch of the Moodle codebase and installs popular plugins like Codechecker, Moodlecheck, and Mailtest by default.

- **Docker Integration:** Handles the building and running of Docker containers for Moodle, including options for customizing PHP versions and database configurations.

## üìã Contents

- `local.yml`: YAML configuration file defining the local environment's dependencies.
- `webserver.dockerfile`: Dockerfile for configuring the web server container.
- `setup.sh`: Shell script that orchestrates the entire Docker environment setup process.

## üíª Usage

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed and configured on your system:

- Docker Desktop. If you don't have it, you can download it [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

- [WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) enabled and properly set up on your Windows system. If not, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

### 2. Quick Installation

Follow these steps to set up your Moodle Docker development environment quickly:

> **_NOTICE:_** The setup script does not include the Moodle codebase within the `html` directory. You will need to add the Moodle codebase manually after running the script.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository into your WSL environment, preferably inside the `/home/$USER` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TsikaAndreas/moodle-docker-dev-tool.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change to the `moodle-docker-dev-tool` directory:

```bash
cd moodle-docker-dev-tool
```

### 3. Set Permissions

Grant executable permissions to the `setup.sh` script:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

### 4. Run the Setup Script
